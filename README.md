RSS feeds for [Everyman Cinema](https://www.everymancinema.com) film releases.

## Why?

I wanted a feed of new film releases within my
[Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) client for my local cinema.

## Feeds

Each feed is an [RSS 2.0](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification) feed,
served over HTTPS.

### Cinema Feeds

You can get a feed of all new films for a specific Everyman Cinema:

```
https://everyman-rss.revcd.com/films?cinema=broadgate
```

See a list of all available cinemas
[below](https://everyman-rss.revcd.com/#cinemas).

### Caching

Feeds are cached for 5 minutes.

### OpenAPI Code Generation
